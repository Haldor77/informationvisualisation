# Introduction

Climate change and public health are increasingly interconnected domains of concern. A growing body of evidence suggests that rising carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, primarily from fossil fuel combustion,may be adversely affecting human health and reducing the number of years individuals live in good health (Greenstone & Fan, 2021). This data story explores the potential impact of CO₂ emissions on healthy life expectancy at birth across countries from 2000 to 2021. Specifically, we examine two contrasting perspectives on this complex issue.
