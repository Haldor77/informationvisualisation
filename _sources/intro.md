# Introduction 
For over a century, CO₂ emissions have fueled our industries, powered our economies, and changed our planet. While the environmental effects are widely discussed, far less attention is paid to a critical question: what does this mean for human health?
This story explores the relationship between CO₂ emissions and healthy life expectancy across countries from 2000 to 2021. Using data from Our World in Data and the World Health Organization, we analyze whether countries with high emissions actually see worse health outcomes or whether emissions are simply a side effect of progress.

We explore two perspectives:

# Perspective 1: 
Emissions harm health by increasing disease and reducing healthy years (Greenstone & Fan, 2021).

# Perspective 2:
Development, not emissions, drives health; wealthier nations often emit more but also live longer (Deaton, 2003; Rosling et al., 2018).

In the following sections, we introduce the datasets and then present visual evidence for each perspective. The goal is to understand whether CO₂ emissions are correlated with healthy life expectancy and to untangle the influence of development and policy factors.
